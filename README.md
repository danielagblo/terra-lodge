### Shared Interaction Patterns

- The top navigation highlights the active route.
- Room cards always offer:
  - `View Details`
  - `Book Now`
- The FAB includes:
  - WhatsApp shortcut
  - `Check Availability`
  - `Back to Top`
- The `Check Availability` actions navigate to the rooms page with selected values in the URL.
- The FAB availability modal closes after navigation begins.
- Checkout feedback modals are controlled by URL params such as `?modal=success`.

## Admin Area

The admin area is available under `/admin` and uses a protected route shell.

- `/admin/login` is a standalone login page.
- `/admin/dashboard` shows live revenue, booking, occupancy, and recent booking data.
- `/admin/bookings` manages bookings with filters, pagination, and detail modals.
- `/admin/customers` derives customer records from booking history.
- `/admin/payments` derives payment rows from booking/payment states and references.
- `/admin/rooms` provides room create/edit/delete flows, image ordering, tag inputs, and structured metadata fields.
- `/admin/settings` provides operational settings UI with low-friction persistence for the current build.

Admin auth is env-driven:

- `ADMIN_LOGIN_EMAIL`
- `ADMIN_LOGIN_PASSWORD`
- `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`

Room image uploads are currently stored as URL or base64 strings in Neon, and the room editor enforces a configurable image cap via:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_ROOM_IMAGES`

Customer status is derived from booking history:

- `Active` if the customer has recent booking activity
- `VIP` if booking count or spend crosses the configured threshold in the data layer
- `Inactive` if the customer has not booked for a longer period

## Availability Flow

The same availability values are shared across the app:

- check-in date
- check-out date
- guest count
- room type

These values are used in:

- the home page hero search
- the location-section search widget
- the FAB availability modal
- the rooms page filter prefilling

The compact widget layout is intentionally different from the full hero form:

- dates are stacked vertically
- guest and room type dropdowns sit side by side
- the submit button remains below the fields

## Checkout Modal Behavior

The checkout page supports URL-based modal states:

- `/checkout/[roomId]?modal=success`
- `/checkout/[roomId]?modal=failure`
- `/checkout/[roomId]?modal=cancellation`

In development, the checkout page also shows a test-only payment outcome selector so the UI can be exercised without a real payment provider.

## Image Handling

The app uses `next/image` and remote image optimization.

Allowed remote image hosts:

- `lh3.googleusercontent.com`
- `images.unsplash.com`

If you add another remote image source, update [next.config.ts](next.config.ts) so the host is whitelisted.

Room images created in the admin editor are stored as ordered URL or base64 strings in the room record, so the first image acts as the main image and the rest remain in gallery order.

## Icon System

The app uses a centralized Material Symbols icon wrapper:

- font package imported in [app/layout.tsx](app/layout.tsx)
- wrapper component in [components/icon.tsx](components/icon.tsx)

This keeps icon usage consistent across:

- header
- footer
- availability search
- FAB
- room cards
- room detail page
- checkout page

## Environment Variables

The current app expects these environment variables:

- `NEON_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `RESEND_KEY`
- `RESEND_ME`
- `ADMIN_LOGIN_EMAIL`
- `ADMIN_LOGIN_PASSWORD`
- `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_ROOM_IMAGES`

Set them in `.env` or `.env.local` for local development.

Example:

```bash
NEON_URL=postgresql://username:password@your-neon-host.neon.tech/your_database?sslmode=require
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
RESEND_KEY=re_xxx
RESEND_ME=onboarding@resend.dev
ADMIN_LOGIN_EMAIL=admin@terrasanta.com
ADMIN_LOGIN_PASSWORD=TerraSanta@2026
ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET=terra-lodge-admin-session-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_ROOM_IMAGES=6
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start the development server
- `npm run build` - create a production build
- `npm run start` - run the production server
- `npm run lint` - run ESLint

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Add your environment variables to `.env.local`.

3. Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open the app in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Notes

- The app shell already includes the shared header, footer, and FAB in [app/layout.tsx](app/layout.tsx).
- Room data is centralized in [lib/rooms.ts](lib/rooms.ts) so the home page, rooms page, room detail page, and checkout page stay in sync.
- The checkout flow is intentionally UI-only for now.
- The shared header is route-aware and highlights the current page.
- Tailwind editor warnings are intentionally muted in `.vscode/settings.json` for this project setup.

## Build Status

The app has been validated with:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
